# How to install multiple apps in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-multipleApps) using the Appium & NodeJS Language

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP1 that you are testing needs to interact with a few other applications APP2, APP3. In this scenario, LambdaTest offers an easy way out where you can just [upload your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) & add them to the multiple apps array.
It becomes extremely convenient now where you can just add those URLs & run your tests with ease. 

# Steps:

You can add the app URLs fetched by [uploading your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) in the ```otherApps``` capability.

Below is the ```Android.js``` example shown:

```js
var wd = require("wd")
var assert  = require("assert");
var asserter = wd.asserters;
username = (process.env.LT_USERNAME == undefined) ? "username" //Enter the username here
        : process.env.LT_USERNAME
accesskey = (process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY == undefined) ? "access_key" //Enter the access_key here
        : process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY
desired_capabilities = {
    'deviceName':'Galaxy S20',
    'platformVersion':'11',
    'platformName':'android',
    'isRealMobile':true,
    'app':'lt://', //Enter the app_url here
    'visual':true,
    'video': true,
    // ADD THE APP URL OF OTHER APPS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO INSTALL ON THE SAME DEVICE
    'otherApps':['lt:// ', 'lt:// ']   //ENTER THE OTHER APP URLs HERE IN AN ARRAY FORMAT
}
driver = wd.promiseRemote(`https://${username}:${accesskey}@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub`)
async function Androidtest(){
try {
driver.init(desired_capabilities)
.then(function(){
    return driver.waitForElementById('color',10000)
})
.then(function(colorButton){
    return colorButton.click();
})
.then(function(){
    return driver.waitForElementById('Text',10000)
})
.then(function(text){
    text.click()
    return driver.waitForElementById('toast',10000)
})
.then(function(toast){
    toast.click()
    return driver.waitForElementById('notification',10000)
})
.then(function(find){
    find.click()
    driver.quit()
})
}
catch (e) {
    driver.quit()
}
}
Androidtest(); 
```

## Executing The Tests


If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
node android.js
```


If you are using an **android** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding Android app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
node ios.js
```


Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
